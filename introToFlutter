-> UI toolkit from GOOGLE to build natively compiled apps for mobile, web and desktop. 
-> Build iOS and Android apps using a single codebase.
-> Flutter uses DART as a programming language to make apps.
-> Cross platform - Mac / Windows / Linux.
-> Extremley fast.
-> Modern and reactive framework.
-> Beautiful and fluid user interfaces.
-> Flutter needs lesser testing. Because of its single code base, it is sufficient if we write automated tests once for both the platforms.
-> With Flutter, developers has full control over the widgets and its layout.
-> Flutter uses an OOPS programming language called DART(optimized for UI).
-> Everything in flutter is a WIDGET.
-> Flutter uses material design.
WIDGETS:
1) STATELESS WIDGETS : State can't be changed during the runtime of the app.
2) STATEFUL WIDGETS : Mutable state that can be redrawn on the screen multiple times.
 
 -> WIDGETS 
 Everything inside a flutter app is essentially a widget.
 ROOT WIDGET surrounds everything in entire app.
 APP BAR WIDGET at top of app.
 TEXT WIDGET contains title of the app.
 CONTAINER WIDGET shows the things inside app, it also contains TEXT WIDGET.
 
 WIDGET TREE describes the structure of widgets inside your app. Eg. Text widget,Button widget,Row widget,Column Widget,Image widget.
 All widgets in flutter are classes. Each widget has its class which defines its behaviour and how it looks on screen.
